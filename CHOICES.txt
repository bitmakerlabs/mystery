CHOICES

First Choice: 1a.md
Second Choice: Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.
Third Choice: Approach Helga and the Doctor
Fourth Choice: Talk to them directly
Fifth Choice: Wait a minute. Helga should've known not to pick up the pipe. Everyone knows not to touch evidence at a crime scene. UNLESS... she was purposely trying to contaminate the pipe so that you wouldn't be able to lift her prints from it. Accuse her.
